### 03 PYTHON
Python is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation. Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. It is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library. The reason why we used Python is becuase the pyhton is versatile & Interpretor language & is widely used ofr Data Science Purpose. Aprat from that the community of Python is comapratively large enough that help begineers to get started with it.
